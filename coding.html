         <h3> Artificial Intelligence</h3>
          <br /><br />
          Artificial intelligence is a science that has defined its goal as making machines
          do things that would require intelligence if done by humans.
          The desire for intelligent machines was just an elusive dream until the first
          computer was developed. The early computers could manipulate large data bases
          effectively by following prescribed algorithms, but could not reason about the
          information provided. This gave rise to the question of whether computers could
          ever think. Alan Turing defined the intelligent behaviour of a computer as the
          ability to achieve human-level performance in a cognitive task. The Turing test
          provided a basis for the verification and validation of knowledge-based systems.

          <br>Artificial intelligence is the one of the branch of computer science,
          which helps us to make automated electromic devices.It is a truly a revolutionary
          feat of computer science,set tobecome a core component of all modern softwares over
          the coming years and the decades.<br>

          We live in the era of the knowledge revolution, when the power of a nation is
determined not by the number of soldiers in its army but the knowledge it
possesses. Science, medicine, engineering and business propel nations towards a
higher quality of life, but they also require highly qualified and skilful people.
We are now adopting intelligent machines that can capture the expertise of such
knowledgeable people and reason in a manner similar to humans.
The desire for intelligent machines was just an elusive dream until the first
computer was developed. The early computers could manipulate large data bases
effectively by following prescribed algorithms, but could not reason about the
information provided. This gave rise to the question of whether computers could
ever think. Alan Turing defined the intelligent behaviour of a computer as the
ability to achieve human-level performance in a cognitive task. The Turing test
provided a basis for the verification and validation of knowledge-based systems.
